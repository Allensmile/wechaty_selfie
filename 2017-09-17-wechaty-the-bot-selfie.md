Recently I found a fun and easy to use middleware for WeChat, called [Wechaty](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty)
Wechaty can help developers quickly build applications based on Wechat, and as a WeChat middleware, it was born with a huge number of user, So it is easy to find that there are already many applications based on wechaty.

So I also do a fun application based on wechaty - a WeChat robot that scores the self-portrait,which named [wechaty_selfie](https://github.com/huyingxi/wechaty_selfie)

This is a robot based on WeChaty's self-portrait Score. You only need to have a little nodejs basis, at the same time have a little depth of learning the basis, you can build it.

## Let's look at the Results show first


## What are our steps?
* to build the depth of learning model, the most important of course is the data, we crawled the instgram with 'selfie' label dynamic, including the dynamic self-timer picture URL, release time, point praise, the number of comments, this true So that most of them are really self-portrait, beauty and handsome.
* in order to make the training data more convincing, we will release a long time to retain the dynamic information, because we default release time is greater than the threshold of the dynamic access to the number of comments, the number of comments is stable, and the release time is lower than The dynamics of this threshold may not have been sufficient to get enough exposure, here because we crawled the data is not good enough, the time threshold is set to 2000 seconds.
* according to the screening after the dynamic information (self-timer picture URL, the number of praise, the number of comments) and other mapping analysis, view the distribution of the number of praise, we found that most of the points like 0-10, so we are simple and rude Will point praise as a score, and here you can try several variants of the number of features, such as the number of praise + comments and other prescriptions.
* according to the filter after the self-timer picture URL to download pictures, and download the image down reshape, into 224 * 224 dimensions
* to build the neural network, in order to quickly build, we use the image processing network VGG16 feature extraction, and in the top layer to add five full connection layer, and finally a 10 classification of softMax output, and training models to store down, In order to call in the webselfie project
* build wechaty project, including wechaty module and depth learning picture grading model.
* debugging, success



## Appendix, the entire construction process used to what package
![Dennis and Socks]({{site.baseurl}}/download/2017/dcsan-dashbot.jpg)

* pylab: used for drawing
* matplotlib: used for drawing
* requests: used to handle http requests
* numpy: used for matrix operations
* h5py: used for formatting data sets
* keras: for deep learning
* Wechaty: wechat middleware
* Fs: used to transfer pictures


## some optimization recommendations
If you are interested, would like to take this one application for their own and friends around the self-portrait photo recommendations. Then you can consider how many points:
* (1) If you want to use insta's selfie picture when training data, it must crawl for a long time, the score is stable.
* (2) can try several different scoring strategies, I think this is the most fun.
* (3) can build a more complex depth of learning model. There should be a model that is more applicable to the scene.

I strongly recommend that you now click on the link below, there are surprises waiting for youÔºÅ
